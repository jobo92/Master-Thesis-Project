# Master-Thesis-Project
The scripts I created and worked on for my master thesis project in collaboration with another person.



The RestClientExample script makes everything ready for a request to be sent to Azure Computer
Vision OCR, making the results from Azure Computer Vision OCR ready to be shown, and showing
the results in the UI. 

The RestWebClient script handles the communication to and from Azure
Computer Vision OCR. 

The AzureOCRResponse is used to be able to deserialize JSON to objects
that can be used in unity. 

A flowchart showing how the three scripts are used and how they work can be seen below.
